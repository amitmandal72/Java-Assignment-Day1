DAY-1 ASSIGNMENT

Difference between Compiler and Interpreter:

Compiler scans the whole program in one go where as	Interpreter translates program one statement at a time. As compiler scans the code in one go, the errors (if any) are shown at the end together where as Interpreter scans code one line at a time, errors are shown line by line. Main advantage of compilers is itâ€™s execution time where as Due to interpreters being slow in executing the object code, it is preferred less.

Compiler converts the source code into object code where as interpreter does not convert source code into object code instead it scans it line by line.
Compiler does not require source code for later execution where as interpreter requires source code for later execution. Examples of Compiler are C,C++,C#,etc where as Python,ruby,Perl, SNOBOL, MATLAB, etc.
